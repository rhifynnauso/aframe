The text component renders bitmap and signed distance field font text.

| alphaTest     | Discard text pixels if alpha is less than this.         | 0.5                   |
| anchor        | Horizontal positioning (left, center, right, align).    | center                |

| font          | Font file to render text. (stock names; or .fnt URL)    | default               |
| fontImage     | Font image to render text. (from font, or override)     | undefined (from font) |
| height        | Height of text block.                                   | undefined (from text) |
| letterSpacing | The letter spacing, in pixels.                          | 0                     |
| lineHeight    | The line height, in pixels.                             | undefined (from font) |
| opacity       | Opacity (0 = fully transparent, 1 = fully opaque)       | 1.0                   |
| shader        | Shader to render text. (modifiedsdf, sdf, basic, msdf)  | modifiedsdf           |

| wrapCount     | Wrap after this many font characters (more or less).    | 40                    |
| wrapPixels    | Wrap after this many pixels.                            | undefined (wrapCount) |
| zOffset       | Z offset to apply to avoid Z-fighting.                  | 0.001                 |

More details on these properties [here](https://github.com/Jam3/three-bmfont-text#usage).

Explanation of whitespace (formerly 'mode') property [here](https://github.com/mattdesl/word-wrapper).

## Usage

Write some text:

```html
<a-entity text="text: Hello World;"></a-entity>
```

To change the size of the text, increase width, decrease wrapCount (roughly how many characters to fit inside the given width) or wrapPixels,
use the [scale](https://aframe.io/docs/master/components/scale.html) component or position the text closer or further away.

Text can be wrapped by specifying width in A-Frame units.

## Custom Fonts

A guide for generating SDF fonts can be found [here](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Distance-field-fonts);
here is an example comparing [Arial Black and DejaVu](http://i.imgur.com/iWtXHm5.png). 
Bitmap fonts also work, but do not look nearly as good.

Different fonts can be specified with the 'font' and 'fontImage' properties.

```html
<a-entity text="text: Hello World; font:../fonts/DejaVu-sdf.fnt; fontImage:../fonts/DejaVu-sdf.png">
</a-entity>
```

## Limitations

This component does not make use of all of the features of [three-bmfont-text](https://github.com/Jam3/three-bmfont-text) and its sister modules.

Bitmap font rendering limits you to the characters included in the font (Unicode this is not). 
SDF font (in particular) tends to smooth sharp edges though [there are ways around this](https://lambdacube3d.wordpress.com/2014/11/12/playing-around-with-font-rendering/).

#### Additional Information
